# Sonar-Mines-vs.-Rocks
This project is based on the classification of sonar signals using a neural network to identify whether the signal corresponds to a rock or a mine. It is a binary classification task. The project uses deep learning techniques, with regularization applied through a Dropout layer that drops 50% of the data.
